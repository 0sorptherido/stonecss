The movie begins with a flashback to the 6th century AD, when Bodhidharma, a Pallava prince and a master of martial arts and medicine, travels to China to cure a plague. He teaches the Chinese people the art of Shaolin kung fu and becomes a revered figure. However, when he decides to return to India, he is poisoned and buried by the villagers who believe that his presence will keep them safe from diseases.
 
In the present day, Subha Srinivasan, a genetic engineering student, is researching on Bodhidharma's DNA and believes that his skills and knowledge can be revived by activating the genetic memory of his descendant. She finds out that Arvind, a circus artist, is the direct descendant of Bodhidharma and tries to convince him to cooperate with her experiment. However, Arvind is skeptical and reluctant to believe her.
 
Meanwhile, Dong Lee, a Chinese spy and a master of hypnotism, arrives in India with a mission to unleash a biological war on India by spreading a deadly virus that was used in Bodhidharma's time. He also has orders to kill Subha and Arvind before they can revive Bodhidharma's legacy. He uses his hypnotic powers to control people and animals and creates havoc in the city.
 
Subha and Arvind manage to escape from Dong Lee's attacks and hide in a Buddhist monastery. There, Subha injects Arvind with Bodhidharma's DNA and triggers his genetic memory. Arvind begins to experience Bodhidharma's past and learns his skills and secrets. He also develops a romantic relationship with Subha.
 
With the help of a Chinese translator and a hacker friend, Subha and Arvind track down Dong Lee's location and confront him. They engage in a fierce fight, where Arvind uses his newly acquired skills to overpower Dong Lee. Dong Lee tries to hypnotize Arvind, but fails as Arvind has inherited Bodhidharma's strong will. Arvind finally defeats Dong Lee and prevents him from spreading the virus.
 
The movie ends with Subha and Arvind returning to Chennai, where they are hailed as heroes for saving the country. Subha also reveals that she has preserved Bodhidharma's DNA sample for future use.
