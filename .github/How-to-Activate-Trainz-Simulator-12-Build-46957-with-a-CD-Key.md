## Tips and Tricks for Playing Trainz Simulator 12
 
Trainz Simulator 12 is not only a game of building and operating railroads, but also a game of learning and exploring. There are many features and functions that you can discover and use to enhance your experience. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you play Trainz Simulator 12 better:

- If you want to see the KUIDs (unique identifiers) of objects, tracks, trains, etc. in Surveyor mode, you can add this sentence to your trainzoptions file: (-showkuids)[^3^]. This can help you find and manage your content more easily.
- If you want to operate your trains from the cab (CAB) mode instead of the digital control mode (DCC), you need to follow some steps to start and stop your locomotive. For example, for a diesel locomotive, you need to press F/R to confirm your direction, Q to release the brakes, W to increase the throttle, S to stop the throttle, Z and A to apply the brakes[^1^]. Different locomotives may have different controls, so check the manuals or guides for more details.
- If you want to update Trainz Simulator 12 to the latest version, you can use the auto-patch feature that will download and install the updates automatically. You can also download the patches manually from the official website or other sources. Make sure you backup your data before updating.
- If you want to add a standalone game or DLC (such as Settle and Carlisle or Murchison 2) to Trainz Simulator 12, you need to install it separately and then use the Trainz Launcher to select which version you want to play[^1^]. You can also use third-party tools such as TrainzUtil or Trainz Object Explorer to manage your installations.
- If you want to learn more about how to build realistic and prototypical routes, you can check out some online resources such as Wikibooks[^2^], YouTube videos, or other websites. You can also download and study some of the routes made by other users from the Download Station or other platforms.

Trainz Simulator 12 is a game that offers endless possibilities and challenges for railroad enthusiasts. With these tips and tricks, you can enjoy it even more. Have fun!
